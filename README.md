# Pig Game

Welcome to the Pig Game repository! This is a simple and fun dice game that you can play in your browser. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it's fully responsive, allowing you to enjoy it on various devices.

## Game Rules

The Pig Game is a two-player dice game where the players take turns to roll a dice. The main objective of the game is to reach a specific winning score before your opponent does. Here are the basic rules:

1. Each player can roll the dice as many times as they want during their turn. The numbers rolled on the dice are added to the player's current score.
2. However, if a player rolls a 1, their current score is reset to 0, and it becomes the other player's turn.
3. Players have the option to "Hold," which means they add their current score to their total score. After holding, it becomes the other player's turn.
4. The first player to reach the specified winning score (e.g., 100 points) wins the game.
